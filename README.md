# Vending-Machine
This project in Verilog is a digital design that emulates the functionality of a real-world vending machine. It allows users to buy a product and make a payment using a specific amount of money. Once the payment is verified, the product is dispensed, and change, if any, is returned to the user. It accepts only two types of coins and other coins are considered as invalid. The status of the machine is reflected by the state_led output.
